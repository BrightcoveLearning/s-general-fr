    <p>The following are limitations you should be aware of when using remote asset videos: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>SSAI is not supported for remote assets.</li>
      <li>DRM is supported only if you can customize the player to communicate with the DRM license server. This is possible with the Brightcove Player through a plugin. For other players, you will need to consult the player documentation.</li>
      <li>All videos ingested into Video Cloud can be played back in the Brightcove Player. For non-Brightcove players, which is you will mostly encounter in Brightcove Beacon, you will need to verify that the video format is fully supported by each platform. Also, there are a few advanced features of DASH and HLS that Brightcove do not yet support</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For further information on remote asset videos see the <strong>Video Cloud</strong> document <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/media/working-remote-asset-videos.html" target="_blank">Working with Remote Asset Videos</a>. Be aware you will view this video in a new tab.</p>
