    <p>When a movie is displayed in a Brightcove Beacon app, you will also see related content displayed along with the video.</p>

    <p>In this document you will learn:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How Beacon determines what content is related to a specific movie, series, live event and player.</li>
      <li>Where related content is displayed.</li>
    </ul>

    <section class="bcls-section">
      <h2 id="How_is_related_content_determined">How is related content determined?</h2>
      <p>The following determines how content can be defined as related:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only assets of the same asset type can be related. This means only other movies can be related to a movie, only other series can be related to a series, etc.</li>
        <li>Within those assets types, the genre defines related. So movies assigned the genre <strong>Action</strong> will be related content to other movies assigned the genre <strong>Action</strong>.</li>
        <li>If you do not assign a genre, the asset is automatically assigned the genre <strong>No Genre</strong>. All <strong>No Genre</strong> assets are defined as related content.</li>
        <li>Genres can be defined to create a related content relationship. For instance, perhaps you want movies assigned the <strong>Action</strong> genre to be related to <strong>Adventure</strong> movies, and vice versa. This can be done by associating those two different genres as related. Contact customer support to create such a relationship.</li>
      </ul>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">The related content is not returned in any special order and you CANNOT define the order in which related content is displayed.</aside>
